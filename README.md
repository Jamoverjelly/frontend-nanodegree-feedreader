# Feed Reader Testing Project

## Project Overview

In project four of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree, I will starting with files for a web-based application that accesses and reads RSS feeds.  The project files include Jasmine (version 2.1.2) as a  dependency for testing the feed reader's functionality.  The objective for completing this project was to develop all tests needed for ensuring the web app meets its essential business logic requirements in addition to testing key interactions involving the DOM.

The following rationale for completing the project is referenced from Udacity's own guidelines introducing the project.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## Running the Udaci Feed Web App

You can run the Udaci Feed web app and the associated Jasmine tests by downloading or cloning the repository to your own device and then opening the project's `index.html` file in a browser.
